> The next generation Neos CMS interface written in ReactJS with Immutable data structures.


## Features

* Better editing experience for responsive websites.
* Faster load times for the backend.
* No reload constraint for the correct stylesheets on multi-site systems.
* Updated Font-Awesome to v4.5.0 (old icon names are migrated on the fly).


## Installation and usage

1. You need to have latest Neos CMS up & running.

2. Run the following commands:
   ```
   composer require neos/neos-ui:dev-master # install our package
   cd Packages/Application/Neos.Neos.Ui
   source Build/init.sh # do NodeJS stuff ie. install required node version using nvm, install npm deps, copy githooks
   npm run build # build everything using webpack (you might see some webpack warnings, but you can ignore them)
   ```

3. Paste the following configuration into the **head** of your global `Routes.yaml` which is located in `Configuration/`
   ```yaml
  -
    name: 'Neos UI'
    uriPattern: '<NeosUiSubroutes>'
    subRoutes:
      'NeosUiSubroutes':
        package: 'Neos.Neos.Ui'
   ```

Now you are all set up and can open the sub-route `/neos!` to login to the new interface.

__Note: We require [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) as well as the `npm` command to be installed on your system.
If you've installed `nvm` make sure that the next node LTS version `6.3.0` is correctly installed - You can do so by executing `nvm install v6.3.0`.
If you need help setting up `nvm`, `npm` or if you got any other problems, join our [Slack](https://neos-project.slack.com/) channel and we are most happy to help you with it. :).__

#### Code style
Our code style is based upon `xo`, with one big difference - We use 4 spaces instead of tabs, to align our code style a bit with the PSR-2 standard for our PHP codebase. To lint the code, execute `npm run lint` in your shell.

#### Writing unit tests
The unit tests are executed with Karma and PhantomJS.
Instead of relying on the default settings of Karma, we use [chai](http://chaijs.com/) as our assertion library and
[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for spies. To run the unit tests, execute `npm run karma` in your shell.

Adding unit tests is fairly simple, just create a file on the same tree level as your changed/new feature, named `[filename].spec.js` and karma will execute all tests found within the spec file, other than that, just orient yourself on the existing tests.

Use `it.only(() => {})` and `describe.only(() => {})` if you want to run a specific test and not the whole test suite.
